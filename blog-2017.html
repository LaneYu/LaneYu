          In case you might wonder why I'd write the whole website in English, well, simply put, currently the quality of Chinese web fonts are not that satisfying. So, if you wanna <a href="mailto:yulu2426@gmail.com">get in touch</a> in Chinese, by all means, love to make new friends. ðŸ˜¬

          Got any different views with what I said about Chinese web fonts? Awesome! Would be honoured to <a href="mailto:yulu2426@gmail.com">hear</a> your thoughts, I'm all ears. ðŸ˜˜

          As a matter of fact, I kinda suck when it comes to writing things. I guess this might be the primary reason why I'm doing blogs here.

          You see, being a web product designer, there's one crucial skillset we ought to master, which is communicating. You might differ with this: isn't that easy? Well, the way I see it, it's not - we really need to sort our thoughts out before expressing ourselves, or our words may just be less convincing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And how could we do that? Start writing sounds like a good choice, don't you think? ðŸ˜Š
