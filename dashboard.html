          When I first joined Ping++, I was assigned to redesign the dashboard,  since the previous version didn't work well as we expanded to meet the needs of businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending a few days getting to know what it's about, first thing I did is to brainstorm ideas with our team on how to really achieve our product goals. Basically, it would be an all-new dashboard, so I needed to create a new design system for it. The challenge was to incorporate sales' feedback and product requirement into my thinking, build a product that meets the needs of our customers, and have it all done under a tight launch deadline.

        <h3>
          Layout
        </h3>
        <p>
          For the layout, I wanted it to be accessible and intuitive while maintaining simplicity. Here are several quick sketches I did initially.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="img/LE.jpg" alt="Layout exploration" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually we settled on this one.

        <h3>
          Pane
        </h3>
        <p>
          The pane in the dashboard is the essential method for the user to check their existing transactions and etc. I decided to go with this pattern so the user can quickly navigate between orders without losing the context.

        <h3>
          Designing a system
        </h3>
        <p>
          For a brand-new design system, starting from scratch was both exciting and challenging. It needed to remain consistency with the established brand style like our website while developing guidelines and principles for a new platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, the existing brand guidelines really gave me a good place to start, which allowed me to leverage some of the existing patterns, like colors, etc.

        <h4>
          Typography and colors
        </h4>
        <p>
          <img src="img/TC.png" alt="Typography and colors" />
        </p>
        <h4>
          UI components
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><br>
        <h3>
          Summary
        </h3>
        <p>
          Looking back, even though I thought our team did really a good job from ideation to implementation, I believe I would have done better if I could consider the limitations of technology more in the design process, since that's where seemed a bit bumpy during the whole road.
